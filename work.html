                            <p>In my final year of university, I took part in a group design project to produce a hybrid-electric aircraft to be used for thin-haul and on-demand air services. My responsibilities included leading the group for the first semester as well as outlining the systems for fuel, power, flight controls, and cabin conditioning systems. <br> In the second semester, I stepped down as leader and focused on sizing control surfaces and assessing the stability in all flight modes using both mathematical and computational methods.</p>

                            <p>Having picked a final year project focusing on battle damage effects and noticing the emergence of the V-tail configuration (particularly in Unmanned Aerial Systems), I decided to investigate the influence of asymmetric tip loss to V-tail aircraft. For this study, I made use of wind tunnel tests assessing the Short Period Pitching Oscillaiton to analyse the effect on manoeuvrability  and flight characteristics. <br> An upper limit of 65 degrees of dihedral was defined as this only supported 50% loss before significantly increasing pilot workload.</p>

                            <p>Following the 2018/19 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics request for proposal (Undergraduate Team Aircraft - Thin Haul Transport and Air Taxi), I developed a number of concept designs both inspired by existing aircraft and novel ideas. These were a combination of conventional and VTOL designs all adopting some level of electrification. </p>

                            <p>In my third year of university, I took part in a design project to develop a new long haul aircraft, specifically targeted at replacing the A380. Due to the very high seating capacity and lack of orders, the aircraft has now stopped production. <br>My design employed a double-bubble fuselage to allow one half to accommodate for first and business class, and the other for economy. Two high bypass ratio engines were used as opposed to four to reduce noise, and a fully composite body with no windows for increased structural rigidity.</p>
